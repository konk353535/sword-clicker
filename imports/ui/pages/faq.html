<h3>How do I join the Seasonal server?</h3>
<p>Season 1 just finished on 3rd February 2019.  When the season is running, to join the Seasonal server, simply log out and click to register a new account.  Find the server selection option before you register and make sure it's selected with the seasonal server.</p>

<h3>When did Season 1 end?</h3>
<p>Once tower floor 23 is completed.  The original scope of the first seasonal server was to finish floor 23.  As new floors are sometimes added, this may alter future seasons' objectives.</p>

<h3>What happens when Season 1 ends?</h3>
<p>All seasonal characters will be merged to the Classic server.  You will not lose any progress, inventory, or abilities and can immediately continue playing as if nothing changed.</p>

<h3>When does Season 2 start?</h3>
<p>This hasn't been decided since we want to allow players a cool-off period between seasons.  During this time, enjoy new floors 24, 25, and 26 and the new challenges and equipment options they bring as well as future limited-time events.</p>

<h3>How will Season 2 differ from season 1?</h3>
<p>There were many changes throughout Season 1 that altered its difficulty and progression.  In season 2, challenge will continue to be raised and there will be new features added, such as a new community-based system to gain exotic loot and give the entire server bonuses and new way to develop your character into personal, permanent changes that suit your play style.</p>

<h3>Where do I find <i>[some item]</i>?</h3>
<p>There is a player-gathered list of drops available at <a target="_blank" href="/etstats.html">ETStats</a> (cached and no longer updated).</p>

<h3>Can I get a dark mode theme?</h3>
<p>Yes you can, which is supported in most desktop browsers - <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/142303/dark-eternity-tower" target="_blank">click here</a> to check it out.</p>

<h3>Is this developmentally active</h3>
<p>Yes, although the developers and original creator all have full time jobs so there may be irregularities in development cycles, however currently the game devleopment is still in motion.</p>

<h3>How long did this game take to make?</h3>
<p>About 6 months part time for the original game.  Countless hours have been poured in for new content and support since its launch by a small number of volunteer developers.</p>

<h3>What are the games rules?</h3>
<p>
  Alt accounts - Allowed, but keep to a minimum<br />
  Botting - Not allowed, will result in permanent ban<br />
  Macros - No, all actions must be 1:1<br />
  Client addons - Fine, although must be read only. If it's performing actions for you, that's considered botting.<br />

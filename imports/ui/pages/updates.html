  <h2 class="my-3">Saturday 9th February 2019</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>New Stuff</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Bows and quivers are being added to the game with exclusive abilities that only work with bows.  This is an experimental preview for you to play with and provide feedback on.  Bows and quivers need to be crafted (recipes are hidden, look for them in floor 20 as <i>only</i> tier 20 bows and quivers exist in this preview).  There are also bow-specific abilities available in inscription levels 1 and 2.  Please provide feedback in Trello.</li>
      <li>Wood for tiers 21, 23, 25, and 26 have been added.  Woodcutters will automatically start chopping down these logs if they qualify to do so.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Minor Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Seeds, trees, and idols of various woods have been recolored to more closely match their respective tiers.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>UI Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Peaceful abilities will show a new icon over the ability to indicate which abilities can be used in pacifist mode.  Pacifism is an effect that isn't released yet.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="my-3">Friday 8th February 2019</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Hammers are no longer considered staves and can't be used to cast spells.</li>
      <li>Tridents now train end-of-battle skill experience distribution uniquely (instead of behaving like staves).  They now distribute 75% XP toward attack and 25% XP toward defense.</li>
      <li><i>Berserk</i> cooldown has been reduced from 120 seconds to 60 seconds.  While under its effects, you can no longer change your active target manually.</li>
      <li><i>Defensive Stance</i> and <i>Scream</i> now require either a spear or a hammer to use in combat.</li>
      <li><i>Execute</i> now requires a battle axe to use in combat.</li>
      <li>The <i>Magic Blade</i> enchantment has been given a boost to damage equal to twice the player's magic power per hit.  This change effects tridents and the weapon from the 24th floor boss.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Bugfixes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Phoenix Hat</i> and <i>Eternal Flame</i> will no longer reduce your maximum health when their effects trigger.</li>
      <li><i>Devourers</i> will no longer have their 4-second buffs stuck permanently on.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Minor Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Spells that previously required either a staff or wand to use now have an icon showing tridents.  Tridents used to be considered staves but are their own category now.  This effectively changes nothing about the weapon requirements to cast affected spells, however it lets us treat tridents differently in other ways (such as end-of-battle skill experience distribution).</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>UI Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Ability/spell required items to use will now appear as a graphic in more places, not just in your combat loadout.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="my-3">Thursday 7th February 2019</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Bugfixes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed missing item descriptions in hover/tap tooltips.</li>
      <li><i>Twin Blades</i> would sometimes not trigger even when all of its conditions were met.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Minor Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Adventures of higher floor levels (and XP/item rewards) are now being generated (about 60% higher, so if you qualified for floor 10 adventures before, you should see floor 16 adventures, etc.).  Additionally, adventures won't generate past floor 20, ever.</li>
      <li>Made large under-the-hood changes to how companions generate and apply their abilities and effects in combat.  While most of this won't be noticeable to players, some effects will be (such as the appropriate level for bleed was fixed on skeleton and healing strength for several mystic fairy spells).</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="my-3">Wednesday 6th February 2019</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Bugfixes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>All of the titanfoil crafting recipes had the incorrect required crafting level and were fixed.</li>
      <li>Some titanfoil crafting recipes required radiant versions of the item to craft and have been fixed to require astral versions.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Minor Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Lunar New Year 2019 event red envelopes are now available in the gem shop.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>UI Changes</b></li>

    </ul>
    <li><b>Bugfixes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>The required skill to craft woodcutting axes for tiers 24-26 have been fixed.  They were incorrectly set too low.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Lion Dance</i> has been reduced to half effectiveness (5% per player or 10% per player during full/exploration runs).</li>
      <li>Uncommon and rare enemy spawns no longer give any loot benefits if they occur in rooms 1-3 in the tower.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Minor Changes</b></li>

    </ul>
 </ul>
 <h2 class="my-3">Monday 4th February 2019</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>New Stuff</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Scream level 2 can now be inscribed, which adds a 40-second cap to the maximum cooldown.  Scream levels 3-5 can be looted in a few floors in the tower, which lowers this cap to a minimum of 25 seconds for unlimited targets.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Bugfixes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Missing mining anvil recipes for tiers 24+ should now appear in Crafting once you've learned them.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Rapiers have been rebalanced (again, since yesterday), giving them marginal decreases to damage.  Changes will take effect immediately to existing rapiers.</li>
      <li>Extra attempts at the current high tower floor now give the same amount of community rewards as extra points.  Right now, this rate is 10%.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="my-3">Sunday 3rd February 2019</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Season 1 Ends</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Season 1 has ended: the original challenge for this season was to complete the then-highest floor, floor 23, of the tower.  This was achieved today after 198 days since the beginning of the season!</li>
      <li>Everyone from the seasonal server has been transfered over to Classic.  No data is lost during this transfer.</li>
      <li>Leaderboards on the Skills tab are updated every several hours, so don't worry if your name doesn't appear there for a while.</li>

    </ul>
    <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Bonus tower points from non-official attempts have been lowered from 20% to 10%.</li>
      <li>Rapiers have been rebalanced (again, since yesterday), giving them marginal increases to damage and giant increases to accuracy.  Some of the changes will take effect immediately to existing rapiers, but you will want to loot new ones for all the bonuses to take effect.</li>
      <!--<li>The way enchantments and passive abilities are applied in combat have been reworked.  In general, passive abilities will now apply before enchantments do.  This will help prevent situations where items like <i>Rich Snake Skin</i> overwrites any benefits that <i>Defense Up</i> may be providing.</li>-->
      <li>Existing items using the old enchantment system have had their enchantments stripped.</li>
      <li>Existing woodcutter data using the wrong icon have been updated.</li>
      <li>Combat 'maximum time' limit has been raised to 30 minutes for top-tower floor boss fights.  The limit is still 10 minutes for all fights that are single-rooms, full explorations/offs, PQs, and older tower bosses.  The fight will still be forfeited when this time is reached.</li>

      <li>Six new tiers of knives added to floors 21 through 26.</li>
      <li>Twenty-three new tiers of rapiers added throughout the entire tower.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Rapiers have been rebalanced.  Some of the changes will take effect immediately to existing rapiers, but you will want to loot new ones for all the bonuses to take effect.  Additionally, they now favor defense (66%) over offense (33%) when gaining experience (but still train both skills).</li>
      <li><i>Twin Blades</i> can now be used when equipping rapiers.</li>
      <li><i>Gelatinous Cubes</i> will now 'confuse' players (and other allied units) when they split, forcing players to target randomly any time a split happens.</li>

      <li>Tuned (and improved) stats for woodcutting axes from tiers 24+.</li>
      <li>Lowered passive damage stats for elven steel dwarven idols and cursed dwarven idols (they were incorrectly set slightly too high).</li>
      <li>Mining pits will now spawn ores faster the emptier they are.  This means two things: (1) if you are outpacing your general ore spawns with really efficient mining, you should get substantially more overall ores and (2) if you want to focus on specific ores mining faster, you can fire other prospectors and get the speed bonus for an empty pit for just the ores you care about.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Bugfixes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Boss battles should correctly register damage again.</li>

      <li>Added bonus rewards for defeating uncommon and rare spawns.

If a player affected by this debuff becomes active, the debuff will end and the player will deal their full damage again.

    <ul>
      <li>Happy New Year, tower adventurers!  There's a few special surprises waiting for you in floor 12 for a limited time, so make sure you gather your party attitude and search for loot before they're gone!</li>
      <li>Upgrade tomes for levels 4 and 5 of the following abilities have been added as tower drops: <i>Accuracy Up</i>, <i>Armor Up</i>, <i>Attack Up</i>, <i>Critical Up</i>, <i>Defense Up</i>, <i>Healing Power Up</i>, <i>Health Up</i>, <i>Magic Armor Up</i>, <i>Magic Power Up</i>, and <i>Phantom Strikes</i>.  These tomes can be found in floors 8 and up in later rooms of the tower (drop-only, not inscribed).</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Battle axes have had their base critical chance increased from 5% to 25%.  You don't need to craft a new battle axe for the change to take effect.</li>
      <li>Opal chestplates now add maximum health to the wearer based on the total magic armor of the wearer.  Additionally, it will also now restore 3% of the wearer's original maximum health that was reduced from spellcasting whenever the wearer takes damage.  This effect can only trigger once every 5 seconds.</li>
      <li>Wands have had their base magic power increased slightly to help make them more competitive with staves.  You don't need to loot a new wand for the change to take effect.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="my-3">Sunday 30th December 2018</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>New Abilities</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Five new passive abilities have been added to the game, increasing your various base stats when entering combat.  You can find the level 1 tomes for each ability in all rooms throughout the early tower (floors 3 through 7, depending on the ability), including personal quest and adventures of equal floor difficulty.  Upgrades to these abilities are available up to level 3 currently via Inscription.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Minor Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>The old <i>Armor Up</i> ability has been renamed <i>Bolster</i>.</li>
      <li>Spirits have new icons for their persistent spirit buff and occasional blinking out of reality (when they're invulnerable).</li>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Demon's Heart</i> damage has been tweaked so that it divides the damage among party members, so if you're by yourself or part of a smaller team, more of you will take damage (but you'll get the full effect from the damage dealt).</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Bugfixes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Holiday Cheer</i> will no longer apply its effects multiplicatively.</li>
      <li>Holiday gift boxes were missing an item.  As a result, the item has been added and Floor 12 will drop more holiday gift boxes before the event ends after New Year's.</li>

  </ul>
  <h2 class="my-3">Friday 28th December 2018</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Demon's Heart</i> has been reworked again.  Now it will drain health from you and each of your allies every five seconds based on your accuracy.  This damage can be dodged and it can be mitigated with armor; this damage can also kill allies if they're low enough in health.  You will gain a damage bonus based on how much missing life you have and the amount of health you drained recently.  Should you flirt with danger and run a team with multiple demon heart's, your team would have the potential for massive damage but would be very difficult to heal (bring <i>Water Wave</i> and <i>Holiday Cheer</i>, perhaps -- or multiple healers).  Additionally, the base critical chance bonus on the item has been raised from 1% to 10%.  Enjoy and please provide feedback on <a href="https://trello.com/b/pxr6J2rw/eternity-tower" target="_blank">Trello</a>.</li>

    <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Players can now work towards tower floor unlocks through unlimited daily runs.  You still only have three 'official' attempts per day that will give you scores used to earn skills and gems.  Once you've completed three perfect runs in the tower, you can continue to earn extra points that count only toward the tower floor unlock and the contribution leaderboard.  These extra points are less valuable (not 'official attempts') and are reduced to 20% of their value, meaning 5 extra runs are about the same point total as 1 regular official run.  There are no limits to how many extra runs players can attempt at the tower.</li>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Bugfixes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>True damage has been fixed, which means you will take full intended damage from abilities, buffs, and other effects that cause true damage.  You can no longer use Evasive Maneuvers to dodge self-inflicted true damage from Double Edged Sword, for example.</li>
      <li>Floor 17 general loot updated with larch logs instead of gombe (this change affects personal quest loot).</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Ignite is now stackable from multiple casts or triggers, such as a player with a phoenix hat.</li>
      <li>Several woodcutting axes had accuracy inconsistancies with their surrounding tiers' stats.  Cobalt and mithril axes base accuracy raised from 25 to 75, adamantium, fairy steel, elven steel, and cursed axes base accuracy raised from 50 to 75, and darksteel, radiant, and astral wood axes were slightly tweaked for consistency.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Magic tomes for elm logs, black logs, blue gum logs, and cedar logs have been added to Inscription levels 40, 45, 50, and 55.  Consuming them requires Astronomy of equal level (40-55).</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Taunt cooldown will become 2 seconds if the targeted enemy is already targeting you.</li>
      <li>Scream cooldown is now 5 seconds, plus 10 seconds for each affected enemy that isn't already targeting you.</li>
      <li>Affliction cooldown reduced to 5 seconds and now requires 25 water shard fragments (and 1 poison shard) instead of complete water shards to craft casts for.</li>
      <li>Sixth Sense has been replaced with Watchful Aura.  Watchful Aura provides a defensive bonus like Sixth Sense did and will also heal you when you successfully dodge damage.  The heal effect can trigger only every 5 seconds.  If you already have Sixth Sense tomes or know the Sixth Sense ability, you will automatically have Watchful Aura.</li>
      <li>Polished and sculpted ores are now found throughout the tower to compliment gold drops.</li>
      <li>Instead of random lavender dropping from floors 1-18, they're now dropped from floors 1-10 and chilli drops from floors 11-21.</li>
      <li>Essence from the previous floor can drop on any floor now (for example, carbon essence can drop from floor 9 in addition to the steel essence found there).</li>
      <li>Drop rates for general loot on each floor has been normalized (some floors had peculiar drop rates for pickaxes, ore bars, logs, etc.).</li>
      <li>Poison shard fragments are a bit more accessible in F5R7 and now F8R1 with marginally-higher drop rates than before.</li>
      <li>Watchful Aura now uses your original maximum health when calculating heal amounts.  This should prevent it from healing less and less as you use up max health to cast spells as a mage.</li>
      <li>Bleed can now be stacked from players just like it's stacked from rats and vampires.</li>
      <li>Stackable effects no longer all end when one of them was supposed to end.  For example, multiple bleeds could previously all end if one of the bleed timers ran out to 0.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Quality of Life Improvements</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Spells and abilities that require a target when there is only a single target to choose from will no longer require another click to confirm the spell/ability.  For example, casting Mending Water when you're the only friendly unit in battle will cast immediately when you trigger it, instead of requiring you to click yourself first.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Cosmetic Updates</b></li>

      <li>The way loot was generated for adventures has been tweaked which will result in slightly more drops than before.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Quality of Life Improvements</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Ability and spell cooldowns reset a moment after combat ends, rather than cooldown at double speed.  With an energy limit, there's no reason to artificially delay combats with very long cooldowns between battles: this was making for a poor grouping experience and was forcing players to avoid using more interesting spells.</li>
      <li>The max chat message length has been doubled as the current length limit was too restrictive.</li>

    <li><b>New Items</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Pine, ash, maple, cherry, and elm staves are now craftable.</li>
      <li>Magical wands, orbs, and tomes for tiers 1-20 (copper through cursed) are now available from floors 1-20 in the tower.  Wands are a main-hand magic item that aren't as powerful as staves, but can be used in conjunction with off-hand items like shields, knives, orbs, and magical tomes.  Orbs and magical tomes are off-hand magical objects: orbs have stronger magic power and some defense while tomes have stronger healing bonuses.  When combined with orbs or magical tomes, wands can easily exceed the magic power and healing bonuses of crafted magic staves making them a superior equipment choice for magic.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>All crafted staves now have a healing bonus, not just every other tier.</li>
      <li>Crafted staves have had their healing power reduced from 8% to 5%.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="my-3">Saturday 3rd November 2018</h2>

      <li>Beavers chance to inflict armor reduction has been reduced and can only be applied a maximum of two times for a total of 66% armor reduction instead of 100%.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>New Items</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Kite shields from every tier (copper+) are now available for every floor in the tower.  Kite shields provide a massive armor and defense bonus over craftable shields, but suffer from accuracy and attack speed penalties.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="my-3">Friday 2nd November 2018</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Bugfixes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Abilities and spells that target a single enemy without any valid enemy targets will no longer use up cooldown or casting resources.  This could happen in between rooms in a tower where there is a brief moment when no enemies are on screen yet.</li>
      <li>Players who are dead can no longer use amulet click damage.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Combat delay at the start of each new combat and room changes in tower exploration runs has returned.  For about a second, no actions can occur and any abilities a player uses (including taunting, changing targets, etc.) will resolve first during this pause.  Any ability use attempts are queued, even if no indication is given (no need to mash keys).</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

    <li><b>Cosmetic Updates</b></li>

                    <li>The combat server has been adjusted to process ticks twice as fast now.  Everything has been normalized to this new tick speed so there won't be any changes to player or enemy attack speed, the auto-attack protection at the beginning of each battle and room is still 800ms (8 ticks now instead of 4), etc.  There are effectively only two things you'll notice: (1) attack speed can be theoretically buffed to 10/s now since that's 1 attack per tick instead of 5/s and (2) cooldowns and timers on buffs in battle will decrement by 0.1s instead of 0.2s.</li>

            <li><b>Feature Update: Reforging v2</b></li>
            <li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The reforging system has been reworked: we now present to you <b>Reforging v2</b>!</li>
                    <li>Items can no longer break when failing to reforge, with or without a crafting buff.</li>
                    <li>All reforging now incurs an actual resource cost of materials and gold.  This cost increases with the tier of the item, how many times you've attempted to reforge it before, and the rarity tier of the item.  These costs are halved when a global crafting buff is active.</li>
                    <li>Reforge attempts with a specific item only increase, never decrease.  If you've failed four times in a row and then succeeded once, it now has five additional reforge attempts tracked on that item.  Remember: this increases the cost, so be careful about deciding when you want to try to reforge.</li>
                    <li>Cancelling your reforge attempt from the queue will return you any resources or gold you spent to reforge it and will not increase the counter for how many reforge attempts you've made with that item.</li>
                    <li>Reforge failures do not guarantee a downgrade of rarity tier, but if you do fail there is a 10% chance of critically failing.  Critical failures will still reduce the rarity tier of the item.  This chance is reduced to 5% when a global crafting buff is active.</li>

You can disable this option from the <b>Appearance</b> menu.  A red dot means the feature's primary use is idle while a yellow dot means a secondary use is idle (such as reforging).

                <ul>
                    <li>We realize there are balance issues with high-end items dropping from personal quest that trivializes challenge and many rewards from the tower.  This is something we'll be rebalancing for the next iteration of the tower (consider this more like season 5).  Given that we want all the classes to enjoy an even and balanced playing field and personal quest has already been dropping high end broad swords, kite shields, knives, and such, we'd prefer not to ruin anyone's day by taking those items away in the name of balance.  Instead, for this current server we'll continue to ramp up challenge in the tower and maintain our position that personal quest simply can't drop items above tier 20.  That means the tower will catch up, pose a challenge, and offer better rewards (even if it does take you high end grinders a while to get there).</li>

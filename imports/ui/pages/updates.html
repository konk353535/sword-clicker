    <h2 class="my-3">Sunday 1st October 2023</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>UI Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Various improvements have been made to the dark mode theme for compatibility with dark and black graphics and item rarity tiers.</li>
            <li>The chat popup and full-page chat window should both be better behaved about not cutting off chat text and the input bar across various devices.</li>
            <li>Updated the tower lobby battle page to always show your daily official attempts, even when the boss is unlocked now.</li>
            <li>Updated the floor and boss timer resets to show minutes now, instead of rounding to hours.</li>
            <li>Added a small text blurb when players have no tower contributions today.</li>
            <li>More consistent styling for buttons in dark theme.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
 
    <h2 class="my-3">Saturday 30th September 2023</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>New Stuff</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>A new ability Distract has been added to Inscription at level 22 that lets a player detaunt enemies, forcing them to find someone else to attack if possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Balance Changee</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Many rare seeds are now available to purchase in the farming shop at very high Farming skill levels and gold costs to purchase.  The Farming skill cost to plant these seeds are still the same (and much lower) so if you loot them or get them from the Town buff, you can still plant them.  This will help players with bad RNG or who play the game less frequently still able to work towards unlocking all of the abilities and spells that require rarer inscription materials.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>UI Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Low damage combat hits will now show as being absorbed by the enemy's armor instead of tiny fractional damage amount.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
 
    <h2 class="my-3">Friday 29th September 2023</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Feature Update</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>We have re-enabled the Town Donated Items view feature, so you can now see what other players have donated and see the upgrade progress for each town location.  Items are now consolidated into one stack, so you can no longer view the individual donors.  These updates resolve a number of large performance issues the system previously had.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Graphics</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Added new sprites from <a href="https://eternitytower.net/profile/chloette">Chloette</a> for bucklers, silver essence walls, bamboo walls, bamboo huts, and gold crowns!</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Bugfixes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Daily resets should correctly reset daily official attempts correctly now, including resets when the boss dies and a new floor opens.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>UI Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>A new option has been added to enable a large chat mode (non-mobile).</li>
            <li>The post-combat summary will now display damage mitigated (thanks to physical armor and magic armor) and attacks dodged.  There are no achievements for this, it's just stats to help understand how your armor and defense stats benefit you.</li>
            <li>Some text describing the current floor has been cleaned up in the Tower.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

        <li><b>UI Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Bonus damage from non-weapon equipped items (such as horned helms, knives, etc.) will now display the total bonus damage added to your attacks and not the individual additions to your minimum and maxium damage, which was causing some confusion.</li>
            <li>Quivers are now named for the tier of wood they're crafted from instead of the metal for that tier.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

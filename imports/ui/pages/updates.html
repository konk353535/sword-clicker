    <h2 class="my-3">Friday 6th October 2023</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>New Feature: Classes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Upon clearing the Tower floor 10 and claiming the associated achievement, you will unlock this new feature which lets you set your active character Class!</li>
            <li>When you first unlock the feature, you will automatically become a <i>Wanderer</i>, the base class that does not have any specific benefits other than an additional 3 ability slots to use.</li>
            <li>A new option in the Battle > Loadout page (visible in Solo and Group battle types) will appear with options to select and view all of the available classes, including a full description of every ability and trait that each class offers.</li>
            <li>When changing to a new class, you will enter a 12-hour cooldown period where you may not change to any other class during the duration.  Tokens are available in the Shop to skip this cooldown limitation, but in general we want the selection of playing a class to be permanent enough for players to enjoy the strategic value while not too permanent that you can't change your mind later on.</li>
            <li>If you would like to read the details available for all of the classes in advance, you may <a href="#" class="view-class-details-link">view them here</a>.  Spoilers, obviously!</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>UI Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Your reforging "roll" has been tweaked to not round up numbers visually.  For example, previously rolling a 79.95 would round up to 80.0 and would be frustrating if the game said you needed an 80.0 but still failed.</li>
            <li>Blue text links are now easier to see in dark mode.</li>
            <li>The close "X" button for popup prompts is now themed properly in dark mode.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="my-3">Thursday 5th October 2023</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Bugfixes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Evasive Maneuvers and Precise Shots should now properly extend their duration as the level of the ability is raised.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>UI Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Buffs that extend their own duration will now show properly in the realtime battle interface.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="my-3">Wednesday 4th October 2023</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Each new room in the tower now has the same auto-attack tick delay as the first room.  This delay is 0.8 seconds and prevents either side from auto-attacking during this time to give players a more fair chance to load in and react to the battle.  Keep in mind that this delay only affects auto-attacks and both friendly and enemy units can still use abilities during this time and passive effects will still occur</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>UI Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>When equipment slots are displayed, the display of neck items has been moved to show before head items in order to group the equipment items together.</li>
            <li>Chat names and channels will now appear bold to increase readability.</li>
            <li>The skill XP bar in dark mode under Rankings is now easier to read.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Performance Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Town donations have been further optimized to reduce network overhead.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="my-3">Tuesday 3rd October 2023</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>UI Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Wands are now named for the tier of wood they're looted from instead of the metal for that tier.</li>
            <li>Renamed "magic wood" to "sagewood".</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Performance Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Tower Floor loot has been highly optimized to reduce network overhead.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="my-3">Monday 2nd October 2023</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>UI Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Black or very dark gray dark mode icons have been color-inverted to be white so they are visible under this theme.</li>
            <li>Text in the Tower/group lobby page have been updated to better indicate if the boss is locked, how much health it has, floor progression, and official attempts/contribution status.</li>
            <li>Passive combat abilities and companion abilities will no longer how their hotkey label during battle.</li>
            <li>The hotkey label for changing targets has been uppercased from "t" to "T".</li>
            <li>Renamed "chili" back to "chilli".</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="my-3">Sunday 1st October 2023</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Bugfixes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The town multi-donate will no longer be active when switching away from the town tab.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>UI Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The town goods will now only update when you first go to the page. For now, this means that you will need to navigate to a different tab then back to see the new donations. Your karma values will update immediately however.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="my-3">Sunday 1st October 2023</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The winds shift and stir, and you feel a change in the air. Sweat begins to drip down your neck, and a menacing aura creeps in around you as you survey the tower floor.</li>
            <li>The difficulty of the top tower floor will now scale based on your group's average combat skill levels.</li>
            <li>For the most highly skilled groups, the difficulty will scale up to 4 floors past the current top tower floor.</li>
            <li>This means, for example, a very skilled group battling Floor 7 will experience combat at the equivalent of a Floor 11 level.</li>
            <li>This does not affect other floors, the scaling will only affect players fighting on the current top tower floor.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>UI Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Various improvements have been made to the dark mode theme for compatibility with dark and black graphics and item rarity tiers.</li>
            <li>The chat popup and full-page chat window should both be better behaved about not cutting off chat text and the input bar across various devices.</li>
            <li>Updated the tower lobby battle page to always show your daily official attempts, even when the boss is unlocked now.</li>
            <li>Updated the floor and boss timer resets to show minutes now, instead of rounding to hours.</li>
            <li>Added a small text blurb when players have no tower contributions today.</li>
            <li>More consistent styling for buttons in dark theme.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
 
    <h2 class="my-3">Saturday 30th September 2023</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>New Stuff</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>A new ability Distract has been added to Inscription at level 22 that lets a player detaunt enemies, forcing them to find someone else to attack if possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Balance Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Many rare seeds are now available to purchase in the farming shop at very high Farming skill levels and gold costs to purchase.  The Farming skill cost to plant these seeds are still the same (and much lower) so if you loot them or get them from the Town buff, you can still plant them.  This will help players with bad RNG or who play the game less frequently still able to work towards unlocking all of the abilities and spells that require rarer inscription materials.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>UI Changes</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Low damage combat hits will now show as being absorbed by the enemy's armor instead of tiny fractional damage amount.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
 
    <h2 class="my-3">Friday 29th September 2023</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Feature Update</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>We have re-enabled the Town Donated Items view feature, so you can now see what other players have donated and see the upgrade progress for each town location.  Items are now consolidated into one stack, so you can no longer view the individual donors.  These updates resolve a number of large performance issues the system previously had.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Graphics</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Added new sprites from <a href="https://eternitytower.net/profile/chloette">Chloette</a> for bucklers, silver essence walls, bamboo walls, bamboo huts, and gold crowns!</li>

            <li>The post-combat summary will now display damage mitigated (thanks to physical armor and magic armor) and attacks dodged.  There are no achievements for this, it's just stats to help understand how your armor and defense stats benefit you.</li>
            <li>Some text describing the current floor has been cleaned up in the Tower.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Bonus damage from non-weapon equipped items (such as horned helms, knives, etc.) will now display the total bonus damage added to your attacks and not the individual additions to your minimum and maxium damage, which was causing some confusion.</li>
            <li>Quivers are now named for the tier of wood they're crafted from instead of the metal for that tier.</li>
        </ul>
